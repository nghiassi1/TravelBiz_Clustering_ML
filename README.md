# TravelBiz_Clustering_ML
I am pleased to present the outcomes of our recent project, where our team of consultants was engaged by an online travel and tourism organization, Travelbiz. Our primary objective was to identify and describe clusters of users based on their ratings of various attributes across European destinations. To accomplish this, we analyzed a real dataset comprising user ratings from Google reviews in 2018, encompassing 24 categories of attractions and totaling 5456 ratings.

During the exploratory data analysis phase, we conducted a comprehensive examination of the dataset, uncovering noteworthy patterns and insights. We employed various techniques such as histograms, summary statistics, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to understand the underlying relationships among the variables and gain deeper insights into the dataset's structure.

To identify and describe user segments, we utilized Machine Learning Clustering Models, including K-means, PAM, and Hierarchical clustering algorithms. Through rigorous evaluation, including silhouette analysis, we selected the clustering model that provided the most meaningful and interpretable results.

Based on our analysis, we provided strategic recommendations to the travel management team at Travelbiz. These recommendations included tailored travel product packages, positioning strategies, and targeted approaches for potential customers within each identified segment. By aligning their offerings with customer preferences, Travelbiz can effectively cater to the diverse needs and interests of their customer base.

I am pleased to share our findings, detailed code, and actionable recommendations with the team at Travelbiz. This project provided valuable insights and allowed us to contribute to the development of effective marketing strategies for the travel industry.
